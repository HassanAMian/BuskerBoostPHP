# BuskerBoostPHP

BuskerBoostPHP is a social media application that allows you to follow and tip street performers, who can post status messages with information on where they're going to be to interact with and grow their audience.

This project is a PHP version of the RoR application BuskerBoost, with some added features and styles which will be incorporated into the original version.   

Like BuskerBoost, BuskerBoostPHP is long term hobby project which will test my ability to incorporate simple features that I have learned into a multifunctional dynamic application.  

BuskerBoostPHP uses PHP, mySQLi, HTML5, CSS3 (Bootstrap CSS framework), JavaScript, and jQuery (any additional languages/tools/libraries/frameworks used as the application progresses will be added here).  After primary functionality is established, 

Planned Features include:
- Artist profile pages that allow users to post where they will be
- Ability to tip artists electronically (API TBA)
- Ability to create crowd funding pages (API TBA)
- Direct Messaging between users
- @Mentions/hashtags 
- YouTube and SoundCloud API integration to allow users to share their work
